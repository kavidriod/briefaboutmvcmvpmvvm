Summary
MVC: The Controller manages the interaction between the Model and the View (Activity).
MVP: The Presenter handles the logic and interacts with both the Model and the View (Interface and Activity).
MVVM: The ViewModel manages the data and business logic, while the View (Activity) observes the ViewModel for changes.

===========================================

MVC (Model-View-Controller)
Advantages:
Separation of Concerns: MVC clearly separates the application logic, UI, and input control, making it easier to manage and scale.
Parallel Development: Developers can work on the Model, View, and Controller simultaneously, improving productivity.
Reusable Code: The separation of concerns leads to more reusable code components.

Disadvantages:
Complexity: As the application grows, managing the interactions between the Model, View, and Controller can become complex.
Controller Bloat: Controllers can become large and difficult to maintain as they handle both business logic and input handling.
Difficult to Test: Testing can be challenging since business logic and UI logic are intertwined in the Controller.

===========================================

MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
Advantages:
Separation of Concerns: MVP offers better separation of concerns than MVC, as the Presenter handles the logic, and the View is more passive.
Improved Testability: Presenters are easier to unit test compared to Controllers in MVC because they contain most of the logic.
Flexibility: The View and Presenter can be developed and tested independently, allowing for more flexible development and testing processes.

Disadvantages:
Complexity: The communication between the View and the Presenter can become complex, especially in large applications.
Presenter Bloat: Similar to MVC, the Presenter can become bloated with logic and become difficult to maintain.
Difficult Coordination: Coordinating between multiple Presenters and Views can be challenging.

===========================================

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

Advantages:
Separation of Concerns: MVVM provides the best separation of concerns, with the ViewModel handling all business logic and the View focusing solely on UI.
Data Binding: Automatic data synchronization between the View and ViewModel simplifies UI updates and reduces boilerplate code.
Improved Testability: ViewModels are easier to unit test since they contain all the business logic and are independent of the UI framework.
Scalability: MVVM scales well for large applications due to its clear separation of roles and responsibilities.

Disadvantages:
Complexity: MVVM can be more complex to set up and understand, especially for beginners.
Data Binding Issues: Debugging data binding issues can be difficult, as the binding occurs automatically and may not be straightforward to trace.
Overhead: The overhead of setting up and maintaining data bindings and ViewModels can be significant, especially for simple applications.
